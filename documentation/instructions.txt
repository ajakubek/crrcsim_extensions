
!!!! This file describes a very old version  !!!!
!!!!   of CRRCSim, not the current one       !!!!



Step 1:
  Download the latest crrcsim zip file from 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crrcsim/files/

Right now, it's crrcsim7.zip.
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crrcsim/files/crrcsim7.zip

Step 2:
  Download port95nt.exe
ftp://ftp.keithley.com/pub/metrabyte/unsupport/port95nt.exe
or
http://www.naughter.com/download/port95nt.exe
or
http://www.sstnet.com/ftp/unsupported/port95nt.exe

Step 3:
  Download and install SDL-1.2 into the system32 directory
http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.7-win32.zip

Step 4:
  Dowload the latest glut library from
http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html

As of now, the latest version is
http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut/glut-3.7.3-dlls.zip

Step 5:
  Unzip the crrcsim zip file.  I recommend unzipping it into a
  directory called "c:\crrcsim"

Step 6:
Unzip the glut-3.7.3-dlls.zip using a program like WinZip.  You can
put them into the directory where you unzipped crrcsim, or the
c:\windows\system directory, whichever you prefer. If you plan on
running other programs that will use glut, put them in the
c:\windows\system directory. 

Step 7:
  Run the port95nt.exe program to install the printer port driver for
  crrcsim.  Follow the instructions.

Step 8:
  Check your c:\windows\system directory to make sure you have a file
  called opengl32.dll  This indicates you have openGl graphics support
  installed.  This will atleast get the simulator up and running.  If
  it runs really slowly, and you have a computer that is less than a
  couple of years old, it probably has a graphics card that supports
  hardware accelerated OpenGL. Visit the www.glsetup.com website, or
  the web site of the manufacturer of your graphics card for further
  information on installing opengl support.  You can determine what
  kind of graphics card you have by clicking 
  Start-Settings-ControlPanel-Display-Settings

  If your have a computer that doesn't support hardware accelerated
  OpenGL, you  should start the program WordPad in the
  "start,accessories" menu and  open the file c:\crrcsim\crrcsim.cfg.
  Change the variables  use_textures to FALSE, and shading to FLAT.
  This will make things  uglier, but it will be faster.

Step 9:
  Run crrcsim!  See the commands at the bottom of the file on how to
  control the plane.

Step 10:
  To use different planes, you will need to pass the name of the plane
  as a command line parameter.  You can open a msdos window and type
  the following commands:

  cd c:\crrcsim
  crrcsim models/sport.air

  or, whatever other .air file you want to try.  Another way to do
  this is to click on Start-Run-Browse, then find crrcsim.exe, and
  then click OK.  Now add the name of the plane to the end of the
  command that appears in the Run box.  For example:
    c:\crrcsim\crrcsim.exe models/sport.air
  Then click OK.


Step 11:
  You can play with the setup of the simulator by editing the
  crrcsim.cfg file, and the various .air files.  Use wordpad, located
  in the Start, Programs, Accessories menu.  If you have a fast OpenGL
  graphics card, I recommend changing the fullscreen variable to TRUE,
  and the x_resolution and y_resolution to the maximum that your card
  supports.

    If you have a joystick, you can set the input_method
  variable to JOYSTICK_2 or JOYSTICK_3.  If you have one of my
  transmitter interfaces, set the input_method variable to PARALLEL1
  or PARALLEL2 and the radio_type to FUTABA, or AIRTRONICS, or JR.
  Depending on what you are using.

  You can also play with the wind speed and direction and the number
  of thermals and their strength.

  Editing the .air file lets you mess with the plane behaviour.

CRRCsim commands:
  First of all, the position of the mouse determines the aileron and
  elevator input if you have input_method set to MOUSE  (the default
  setting).  So to steer the plane you must move the mouse as though
  it was the right stick of your transmitter.

 r          restarts after crash
 t          toggles training mode which displays the location of the thermals
 page up    increase throttle  (if you aren't using JOYSTICK_3  or better) 
 page down  decrease throttle  (if you aren't using JOYSTICK_3 or better)
 +          zoom in   (assuming zoom_control is KEYBOARD)
 -          zoom out   (assuming zoom_control is KEYBOARD)
 right arrow/KP6  right rudder
 left arrow/KP4   left rudder
 up arrow/KP8     elevator up   (only in keyboard mode)
 down arrow/KP2   elevator down (only in keyboard mode)
 KP7              aileron left  (only in keyboard mode)
 KP9              aileron right (only in keyboard mode)
 KP5              reset controls to neutral position (only in keyboard mode)
 escape           exit

 Note that for the KPx keys you should have turned Num-Lock on !

 clicking the right mouse button will pause the simulation, clicking
 it again will un-pause the simulation

Good luck!
