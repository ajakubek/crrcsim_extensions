Hello Crrsim (F3F) Fans.

Notice, actually this models are useable with the new 0.9.5 Betaversion ( Thank's a lot to all the programmers who built that great version ).


Unpack all the ".air" files to your, i.e. "C:\Programme\CRRCSIM\models\..." Dir.
Unpack all the ".ac " files to your, i.e. "C:\Programme\CRRCSIM\objekts\..." Dir.
Unpack all the ".rgb" files to your, i.e. "C:\Programme\CRRCSIM\textures\..." Dir. 

All you have to do is:

Set the deflection of Aileron & Elevator on your Transmitter or in the "Options/Control/Mixer" Menu.

You should decrease the deflection of the Aileron's a little bit so that the plane doesn't roll to hard in turns. 
Don't use to much Elevator !! I recommend to use 30-40% EXPO for Aileron and Elevator.


I may say the behaviour of the Crossfire is maybe not like the real Crossfire because not built with AVL.
This would need the right data from the Crossfire.

If you want to use the  Crossfire in DS mode then I recommend you to set all the thermal settings to "0" and a wind speed of not more than 30ft/s.




Enjoy this beautiful plane ..and... visit www.thuro.at .... the home of the T3D Studio.
